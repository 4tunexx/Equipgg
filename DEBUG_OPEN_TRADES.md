# 🔍 DEBUG: WHY TRADES NOT SHOWING IN OPEN TRADES

## 🎯 CHECK THESE CONSOLE LOGS:

Open **F12 → Console** tab and look for these logs:

---

## 📊 SERVER LOGS (Terminal/Console):

### **1. Check All Open Trades in Database:**
```
🔍 ALL OPEN TRADES in DB: X
```
- **If 0:** No trades exist at all - trade creation failed
- **If 1+:** Trades exist - something else is filtering them out

### **2. Check Trade Details:**
```
🔍 First trade details: {
  id: "trade_xxx",
  sender_id: "user_xxx",
  status: "open",
  expires_at: "2025-10-24T23:00:00Z",
  created_at: "2025-10-24T22:55:00Z",
  isExpired: false,  // ← Should be FALSE
  isSender: false    // ← Should be FALSE (viewing with different account)
}
```

**Check These:**
- ✅ `status: "open"` - Must be "open"
- ✅ `isExpired: false` - Must be false (not expired yet)
- ✅ `isSender: false` - Must be false (you're not the sender)

### **3. Check Query Parameters:**
```
🔍 Current server time: 2025-10-24T22:56:00Z
🔍 Querying for: status=open, sender_id!=user_yyy, expires_at>=2025-10-24T22:56:00Z
```

### **4. Check Results:**
```
✅ Found X open trades
```
- **If 0 but ALL OPEN TRADES was 1+:** Trade was filtered out by query!

---

## 📊 FRONTEND LOGS (Browser Console):

### **1. API Call:**
```
🔥 Fetching OPEN TRADES from API...
```

### **2. API Response:**
```
📦 Open Trades API Response: { success: true, trades: [...], total: X }
📦 Total trades from API: X
```
- **If 0:** API returned no trades - issue is server-side
- **If 1+:** API returned trades - check filtering

### **3. Trade Details:**
```
📦 First Trade Full Details: {...}
📦 First Trade expires_at: "2025-10-24T23:00:00Z"
📦 First Trade created_at: "2025-10-24T22:55:00Z"
```

### **4. Frontend Filtering:**
```
🔍 Frontend filtering - current time: 2025-10-24T22:56:00Z

⏱️ Trade trade_xxx expires_at check: {
  expiresAt: "2025-10-24T23:00:00Z",
  remaining: 240000,  // ← Should be POSITIVE!
  isExpired: false    // ← Should be FALSE!
}

✅ Trade trade_xxx passed filters!
```

### **5. Final Count:**
```
📦 Valid trades after filtering: X
```

## 🔍 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

### **Issue 1: ALL OPEN TRADES in DB: 0**
**Problem:** Trade wasn't created
**Check:**
- Did you see "✅ Trade created successfully" when creating?
- Check "My Trades" tab - does it show there?

**Solution:** Create trade didn't work - check create trade logs

---

### **Issue 2: isExpired: true**
**Problem:** Trade expired immediately
**Logs:**
```
isExpired: true
remaining: -100000  // NEGATIVE!
```

**Solution:** Run this SQL in Supabase:
```sql
UPDATE trade_offers
SET expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '5 minutes'
WHERE status = 'open';
```

---

### **Issue 3: isSender: true**
**Problem:** You're viewing from the same account that created the trade
**Logs:**
```
isSender: true  // ❌ Can't see your own trades in Open Trades!
```

**Solution:** 
- Switch to **different account**
- Your own trades show in "My Trades" tab, NOT "Open Trades"

---

### **Issue 4: Found 0 open trades (but ALL OPEN TRADES: 1)**
**Problem:** Query filters blocking the trade
**Check:**
- Is `sender_id` matching current user? (should be different)
- Is `expires_at` in the past? (should be future)

**Solution:** Check the query parameters log:
```
Querying for: sender_id!=user_xxx, expires_at>=TIME
```

Compare:
- Trade `sender_id` vs query `sender_id`
- Trade `expires_at` vs query time

---

### **Issue 5: Frontend filters out trade**
**Problem:** Frontend thinks trade is expired
**Logs:**
```
❌ Filtered out EXPIRED trade: trade_xxx
remaining: -5000  // Negative = expired
```

**Solution:** Server/browser time mismatch - run SQL fix above

## 🎯 WHAT TO SHARE:

Copy and paste these specific logs:

1. **From Server (Terminal):**
```
🔍 ALL OPEN TRADES in DB: ?
🔍 First trade details: { ... }
🔍 Current server time: ?
✅ Found ? open trades
```

2. **From Browser (F12 Console):**
```
📦 Total trades from API: ?
⏱️ Trade ... expires_at check: { remaining: ? }
📦 Valid trades after filtering: ?
```

## 🚀 QUICK TESTS:

### **Test 1: Does trade exist in DB?**
- Check server log: `ALL OPEN TRADES in DB`
- If 0 → Trade creation failed
- If 1+ → Trade exists, filtering issue

### **Test 2: Is trade expired?**
- Check: `isExpired: true/false`
- If true → Run SQL to fix expires_at

### **Test 3: Are you viewing with different account?**
- Check: `isSender: true/false`
- If true → Switch accounts!

### **Test 4: Did API return trades?**
- Check: `Total trades from API`
- If 0 → Server filtered it out
- If 1+ → Frontend filtered it out
