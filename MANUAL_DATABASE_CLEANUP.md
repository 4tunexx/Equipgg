# 🔄 MANUAL DATABASE CLEANUP REQUIRED

## Current Situation:
❌ **Old tables still exist** in your Supabase with wrong structure  
❌ **Automatic migration failed** during deployment  
✅ **Site is deployed** but database needs manual cleanup  

## 🧹 Complete Database Reset (Required)

You need to manually clean up and recreate the database with the correct structure.

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your **EquipGG project**
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run Complete Database Reset
1. **Copy the ENTIRE content** from the file: `complete_database_reset.sql`
2. **Paste it** into the SQL Editor
3. **Click "Run"** button
4. **Wait for success message**: `"Database cleanup and migration completed successfully!"`

### What This Will Do:
🧹 **Cleanup Phase**: 
- Drops all existing problematic tables
- Removes wrong table names (user_activity_feed, etc.)
- Clears old policies

🏗️ **Recreation Phase**:
- Creates tables with **correct column names** (display_name not displayName)
- Creates tables with **correct table names** (activity_feed not user_activity_feed)
- Sets up proper foreign key relationships

✅ **Setup Phase**:
- Enables Row Level Security
- Creates proper access policies
- Adds sample achievements and items
- Creates performance indexes

### Step 3: Verify Success
After running the SQL, you should see:
```
Database cleanup and migration completed successfully!
Tables created: users, matches, activity_feed, achievements, bets, items, user_inventory
```

### Step 4: Test Your Site
- Visit https://equipgg.net
- Try logging in
- Check if leaderboard loads
- Verify achievements appear

## 🚨 Why Manual Cleanup is Needed:
1. **Wrong table structure** - Your current tables have `displayName` instead of `display_name`
2. **Wrong table names** - You have `user_activity_feed` instead of `activity_feed`
3. **Automatic migration failed** - The RPC function doesn't exist in your Supabase
4. **Vercel deployment was failing** - Because migration ran during build

## ✅ After Database Reset:
- ✅ All API routes will work correctly
- ✅ User authentication will function
- ✅ Leaderboard will display data
- ✅ Achievements system will be active
- ✅ Future deployments will work automatically

---

**This is a one-time cleanup.** Once done, your database will have the correct structure and all future deployments will work smoothly!
