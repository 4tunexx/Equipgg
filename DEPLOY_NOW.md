# ðŸš€ READY TO DEPLOY - Manual Migration Instructions

## Status: Ready for Production! âœ…

Your codebase is fully prepared for deployment. Since the local environment uses placeholder values, you'll need to run the database migration directly in Supabase dashboard.

## Quick Migration Steps (5 minutes):

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Select your EquipGG project  
- Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

### 2. Run Migration Scripts (Copy & Paste)

**Step A: Database Cleanup**
```sql
-- Copy the ENTIRE content from: supabase/migrations/00_cleanup_database.sql
-- Paste it in SQL Editor and click "Run"
-- âœ… Should show: "All tables, policies, and data have been cleaned up safely"
```

**Step B: Production Schema**  
```sql
-- Copy the ENTIRE content from: supabase/migrations/production_schema.sql
-- Paste it in SQL Editor and click "Run"
-- âœ… Should show: "Production schema created successfully"
```

**Step C: Game Content Restoration**
```sql
-- Copy the ENTIRE content from: supabase/migrations/seed_game_content.sql  
-- Paste it in SQL Editor and click "Run"
-- âœ… Should show: "Game content seed completed! Achievements, missions, items, perks, and ranks have been restored"
```

### 3. Verify Migration Success
```sql
-- Run this verification query:
SELECT 
  'achievements' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM achievements
UNION ALL
SELECT 'missions', COUNT(*) FROM missions  
UNION ALL
SELECT 'items', COUNT(*) FROM items
UNION ALL
SELECT 'perks', COUNT(*) FROM perks
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'rank_tiers', COUNT(*) FROM rank_tiers;

-- Should show:
-- achievements: ~40
-- missions: ~30  
-- items: ~12
-- perks: ~10
-- rank_tiers: 8
```

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Production

Once migration is complete:

```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Complete production-ready deployment with full game content"
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy to https://equipgg.net
```
