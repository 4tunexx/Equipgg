# Vercel Deployment Fix Checklist

## Issue Summary
The Vercel deployment was failing due to missing UI component imports. The build process couldn't resolve imports like `@/components/ui/button` despite the components existing in the local codebase.

## Fix Implementation
We've implemented the following fixes:

1. **Component Verification Script** (`scripts/ensure-components.js`):
   - Checks if all required UI components exist
   - Validates path resolution configuration
   - Provides detailed diagnostics output

2. **Modified Build Process**:
   - Added prebuild step in package.json to run component verification
   - Created a custom Vercel build script (`scripts/vercel-build-fixed.js`)
   - Updated vercel.json to use the custom build script

## Deployment Steps

1. **Before Deployment**:
   - Make sure all UI components are properly committed to the repository
   - Run `node scripts/ensure-components.js` locally to verify components
   - Test the build locally with `npm run build` to confirm it works

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Push the changes to GitHub
   - Run `npm run vercel:deploy` or trigger deployment from the Vercel dashboard
   - Monitor the build logs for any component verification warnings

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If the build fails, check the Vercel logs for details from the component verification script
   - Ensure all required UI components are available in the repository
   - Verify the path aliases in tsconfig.json and components.json

## Long-term Fixes

For a more permanent solution, consider:

1. **Use shadcn/ui CLI** to ensure all components are properly installed:
   ```
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add label
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
   ```

2. **Update component imports** to use more specific paths if path resolution continues to be an issue:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of
   import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
   
   // Consider
   import { Button } from "../../components/ui/button";
   ```

3. **Implement automated testing** to catch missing component imports before deployment:
   ```
   npm run prebuild && npm test
   ```

## Notes

- The primary issue was related to path resolution during the Vercel build process
- Our fix ensures that all required components are verified before build
- The custom build script provides more detailed error information if issues occur
