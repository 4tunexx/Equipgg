# 🚨 DATABASE SETUP REQUIRED

## Status: Site Deployed Successfully ✅ 
## Database: Needs Manual Setup ⚠️

Your **equipgg.net** is deployed but needs the database schema to be set up manually.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes):

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Select your EquipGG project
- Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### 2. Run Migration SQL
Copy and paste the **entire content** from the file `migration.sql` in your project root:

```sql
-- The complete SQL is in /migration.sql file in your project
-- It includes:
-- ✅ Table creation (users, matches, achievements, etc.)
-- ✅ Correct column names (display_name not displayName)
-- ✅ Proper table names (activity_feed not user_activity_feed)
-- ✅ Sample achievements and items
-- ✅ Security policies
-- ✅ Performance indexes
```

### 3. Click "Run" Button
Wait for the success message: `"Database migration completed successfully!"`

### 4. Verify Setup
After migration, your site will have:
- ✅ User authentication working
- ✅ Leaderboard displaying data
- ✅ Achievements system active
- ✅ Match betting functional

## ⚡ Quick Fix Applied:
- ❌ **OLD**: Database migration ran during build (causing deployment failures)
- ✅ **NEW**: Database migration separated from build process
- ✅ **Result**: Clean deployment + manual database setup

## 🎯 After Database Setup:
Your **equipgg.net** will be 100% operational with:
- Real CS:GO match data
- User profiles and authentication
- Betting system
- Achievement tracking
- Inventory management

---
**This is a one-time setup.** Once the database is migrated, all future deployments will work automatically.
