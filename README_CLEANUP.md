# Cleanup Summary

- All legacy database scripts, Prisma, and SQLite logic have been removed from the codebase.
- The `prisma/` folder and all related schema files are deleted.
- All package.json scripts and dependencies for Prisma and legacy db are removed.
- Only Supabase is now used for all database operations.
- If you need to re-add any scripts, use the new Supabase-based logic as reference.
